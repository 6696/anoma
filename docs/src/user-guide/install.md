# ðŸ’¾ Install Anoma

There's a single command to build and install Anoma executables from source (the node, the client and the wallet). This command will also verify if a compatible version of Tendermint is available, and if not, attempt to install it. Note that currently at least 16GB RAM is needed to build from source.

```bash
make install
```
