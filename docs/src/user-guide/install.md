# ðŸ’¾ Install Anoma

There's a single command to build and install Anoma executables from source (the node, the client and the wallet). This command will also verify that Tendermint with a compatible version is available and if not, attempt to install it. Note that currently at least 16GB RAM is needed to build from source.

```bash
make install
```
